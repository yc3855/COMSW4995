# COMSW4995 Final Project: WaveSimC

This is the repository for our final project for the discpline COMSW4995: Design in C++ at Columbia University during the Fall of 2022.

This project aims to implement in modern C++ a wave equation solver for geophysical application.

In addition, a custom implementation of numpy in modern C++ is also included as a header library.
That library aims to make c++ more pythonic and easier to use for scientific computing.
Instead of numpy n-dimensional arrays the library use boost::multi_array and contains many utilities to expand the functionality of the library.

Please check the [Readme file](README.md) for more information.
